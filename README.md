# requirement-analysi# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository contains the foundational documentation and analysis required for the successful development of a **Booking Management System**. It is part of a real-world simulation project designed to demonstrate key concepts and practices in **Requirement Analysis**—a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a structured process used in the **SDLC** to identify, document, and analyze the functional and non-functional requirements of a software system. It ensures that stakeholder needs are accurately captured and transformed into technical specifications that developers can implement.

Key objectives include:
- Understanding what the system should do (functional).
- Ensuring quality standards are met (non-functional).
- Bridging the gap between business needs and technical solutions.

---

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Clear Understanding of Objectives**  
   Helps teams align on what the software needs to achieve, reducing confusion.

2. **Risk Reduction**  
   Identifying issues early in the development lifecycle helps avoid costly fixes later.

3. **Improved Project Planning**  
   Accurately defined requirements enable better estimation of time, resources, and costs.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering:**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, and research.

- **Requirement Elicitation:**  
  Drawing out unspoken needs and expectations through workshops and brainstorming sessions.

- **Requirement Documentation:**  
  Writing down clear, unambiguous, and verifiable requirements in standardized formats.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:**  
  Breaking down requirements into logical models and diagrams to ensure feasibility.

- **Requirement Validation:**  
  Confirming that documented requirements meet stakeholder expectations and business goals.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Define what the system **should do**.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- Users can create, view, update, or cancel bookings.
- Admins can manage room availability.
- The system sends confirmation emails upon successful booking.

### Non-functional Requirements
Define **how** the system performs or behaves.

**Examples:**
- The system should load the booking page in under 2 seconds.
- Data must be encrypted using AES-256.
- The system must handle up to 500 concurrent users.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interaction between users (actors) and the system.

**Benefits:**
- Clarify user-system interaction.
- Help identify all functional requirements.
- Aid in validating completeness of system features.

**Actors:**  
- Customer  
- Admin  

**Use Cases:**  
- Book Room  
- Cancel Booking  
- View Availability  
- Manage Room Inventory

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions under which a system feature is considered complete and working as intended.

**Importance:**
- Ensure requirements are testable.
- Align expectations between developers and stakeholders.
- Serve as the basis for user acceptance testing (UAT).

**Example (Checkout Feature):**
- **Given** a user has selected a room and entered valid payment details,  
- **When** they click “Confirm Booking,”  
- **Then** the booking should be saved, payment processed, and a confirmation email sent.
